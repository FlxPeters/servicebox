# ServiceBox

Simple, lean service inventory management.

## Development

## What is ServiceBox

See: `/docs`

## Future features

- Validate services based on given rules like "A active service must have a source control link" or "An active service must have an monitoring link".
- Add event logs for stuff like maintenance or incidents
- Add a endpoint entity to document the endpoints of an service like an HTTP or TCP endpoint. This could be handy to provision a monitoring system like we do it with netbox as source for discovery source.

## Credits

ServiceBox is heavily inspired by Netbox, Jira.
